# learn-bun

I created this project as follows:
1. create folder `learn-bun`
2. Run `bun init` and press enter for all options
3. It created .gitignore, bun.lockb, index.ts, package.json, tsconfig.json, README.md

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
